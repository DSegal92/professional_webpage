			<h2 id="project_label">Contact Information Form</h2>
			<p>NOTE: Code is not available for this website. </p>
			<p>This was the first project that I worked on for Vigilant Medical. Using Knockout.js and Ruby on Rails, this is a dynamic form to gather contact information for any number of administrators and doctors at a primary hospital, as well as the network hospitals associated with it. Each hospital has a generated page and password that allows them to at any time update their contacts. </p>

			<p>Pairing a Tropo script with a Rails backend, this website powers the logic and database behind a customizeable phone system. Users can define phones as parts of groups and then apply logic to which phones or groups are called depend on day of the week, time of day, and several other variables. Call logs and information are then organized and stored for easy retrieval when needed. </p>

			<h2 id="project_label"><a href="https://github.com/DSegal92/case_cycling">Case Cycling Website</a></h2>
			<p>In order to prevent the common club website problem of stagnation, I designed this website to be easy for a non-technical user to update or modify, while still maintaining a professional presentation and point of contact with sponsors. Using heavily overwritten Bootstrap and several Javascript assets, this was my first experiment with frontend development.</p>

			<p>My other main project to date is this website. How meta is that? This was my first test of building a website completely from the ground up without any CSS frameworks (aside from 960.gs for the grid). This website was designed for ENGL 398: Professional Comunications for Engineers.</p>

		<h2 id="course_header"> Photography </h2>

		<p id="centered">Photography is one of my favorite hobbies. When I'm not busy with schoolwork or other obligations, I am usually out taking pictures. Along with my personal work, I also collaborate closely with the theater department on campus, taking pictures of weekly improv shows and larger productions. </p>
		<br><p id="centered">My photography has also been featured several times in the Case Reserve Review (a student edited photographic and literary journal accepting submissions from students from any higher learning institute in the United States), including the cover of the Fall 2012 issue, seen below.</p>
		<br> <p id="centered">Some samples of my work can be seen <span class="text_link"><a href="http://500px.com/DSegal92">here.</a></span></p>

		<h2 id="course_header"> Video </h2>
		<p id="centered">Along with photography, I am also a fledling videographer. Most of my projects to this point have been short documentary style films, and they can all be seen at the YouTube link below.</p><br>
		<p id="centered">In addition to these short films, I have also worked with the Case Western Reserve University Marching Spartans to film their halftime shows and other performances (link <span class="text_link"><a href="http://youtube.com/CWRUMarchingSpartans">here</a></span>), and the Co-Op office to produce videos of their roundtable discussions. </p>

		<h2 id="course_header"> Cycling </h2>
		<p id="centered">I took up cycling competitively in the summer of 2012 and am a USAC licensed category 5 road and track cyclist. While an injury early in the season kept me off of the bike for several weeks, I look forward to continuing to train and race both collegiately and in domestic races.</p>
